# Full_Stack_App
 FSJS project 10 is a full stack app build with implementation of React(frontend) and Express(backend).

 This full stack application is providing a way for users to administer a school database containing information about courses: users can interact with the database by retrieving a list of courses, viewing detail for a specific course, as well as creating, updating, and deleting courses in the database.

 The project is made up as 3 steps process. Firstly, the API was created and tested. Secondly, client side was developed and implemented. Thirdly, client and server
 were combined to work together in unison as single full-stack app. 

Technologies used to create the project:
    Client - React Components, React Router, React Context API, React authentication/authorization.
    Server - REST API, Node.js, Express, Sequelize ORM, sqlite3 as database.

Client is set in cliet folder of the project and runs at localhost:3000,
server is set in api folder of the project and runs at localhost:5000.

CORS package is installed on the server side to allow CORS communication with client.

For launching the app run npm start in the api folder, 
then npm start in the client folder.
